I'm happy to announce a partnership between Tiled and [CraftPix.net](https://craftpix.net/), a store that offers high-quality 2D game assets.

In addition to making a generous contribution of $500 per month, which will help me dedicate more time to improving Tiled and adding new features, CraftPix.net is updating their asset packs to include Tiled example files and tileset meta-data. This means that their assets will be even easier to use in Tiled.

In return, there's a new "[Pixel Game Assets](https://craftpix.net/link/TiledHeaderAssets)" link on the navigation bar, leading directly to CraftPix.net. For now it links to a large collection of pixel art game assets, but the plan is to link to a collection of Tiled-ready asset packs in the future. 

## Why This Partnership is Great for You

Benefits of this partnership for Tiled users:

* **Easier integration:** CraftPix.net’s assets will now ship with Tiled example files and meta-data.
* **Support for Tiled development:** Their sponsorship helps me dedicate more time to improving Tiled for everyone.
* **Discover quality assets:** CraftPix.net has a lot to offer, and it’s a resource that is easily overlooked.

## Your Feedback is Important

I’m excited about this collaboration and I hope you’ll find value in it too! If you have any thoughts, questions, or concerns about this partnership or CraftPix.net, please don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you all for your continued support!
